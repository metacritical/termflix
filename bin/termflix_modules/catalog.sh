# Termflix Catalog Module
# Catalog display, grid rendering, and browsing functions
#
# NOTE: Due to the large size of catalog functions (draw_grid_row is ~850 lines,
# display_catalog is ~600 lines), these remain in the main script for now.
# This module will contain helper functions and can be expanded later.
#

# Catalog helper functions will be moved here in future iterations
# For now, the main catalog functions remain in termflix main script:
# - draw_grid_row() - lines 336-850+
# - display_catalog() - lines 2184-2800+  
# - redraw_catalog_page()
# - Catalog browsing logic

# Placeholder for future catalog functions
# This allows the main script to source this module without errors
