# Termflix Torrent Module  
# Torrent streaming and download functions
#
# NOTE: Due to the large size of torrent streaming logic (~1000+ lines),
# these remain in the main script for now.
# This module will contain helper functions and can be expanded later.
#

# Torrent functions will be moved here in future iterations
# For now, the main torrent functions remain in termflix main script:
# - stream_torrent()
# - download_torrent()
# - Player detection and selection
# - peerflix, transmission-cli, webtorrent integration

# Placeholder for future torrent functions
# This allows the main script to source this module without errors
